Django REST Framework 7Hour video notes

endpt = "https://github.com" # for example this is not an API for it returns an html page document.

what api is is :

we use import requests in python
to access the api inside of the responses.
the library itself gives you its API to let you work with API's (LOL)!

import requests
requests.get() <== an API 

API = application programming interface.

Phone has camera. the Camera has API. every app that uses the camera or tweaks it uses the API to grab the data.

web api == http request (there are internetless web apis)
RESt API responses are most of the time json responses
